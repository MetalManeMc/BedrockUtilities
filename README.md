Some useful scripts for Bedrock Addon Development
Every script will be in a different folder

# bone_visibility.py
I have created :bao_icon_python: Python a script to easily switch syntax from part_vilibilityto bone_visiblity. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

1. Copy you complicated deprecated bone_visibility object into the bone_rules variable
2. Set the identifier variable to your geometry identifier
3. Run the script
4. Copy the object outputted to the console and set it as your minecraft:geometry property under components in the BP
5. Copy the contents of <model_identifier>.txt and paste it in component_groups

But just looking at the example I set in the file should be straightforward enough to understand how to use it
